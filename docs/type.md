>Typography is an essential part of the AEMO visual system. When used consistently, it unifies messaging and creates familiarity.

## Primary font

Avenir is the primary font. AEMO communications should use Avenir, including all body copy and headings.

The typeface is made up of multiple weights: Light, Book, Medium, Heavy, and Black. Italicised versions are also included in the family.

The default weight to use is Avenir Light for body copy and Avenir Heavy or Black for headings.

The supporting weights of Avenir may also be used, but usually for emphasis in smaller applications such as captions, tables, charts, and diagrams.

Title and sentence case are preferred. Only use all caps in small instances such as charts, labels, and UI navigation. Avoid adding outlines, drop shadows or other effects to type

## Alternative fonts

In cases where Avenir is not available, alternative fonts should be used as a substitute.

These cases may include digital applications such as HTML emails, internal Microsoft Office templates or digital presentations (such as PowerPoint) that cannot embed fonts.
